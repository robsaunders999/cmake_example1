Example
=======

This is an example of the usage of the cmake buildsystyem repository (**cmake_bs**)

.. _cmake_bs: https://github.com/robsaunders999/cmake_bs


To use the scripts copy bs_clone.cmake to your project dir, and include it 
as shown in the example CMakeLists.txt file.

This places all the build system scripts in ${buildsystem_SOURCE_DIR}
