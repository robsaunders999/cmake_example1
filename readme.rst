Example
=======

This is an example of the usage of the cmake buildsystyem repository (**cmake_bs**)

.. _cmake_bs: https://github.com/robsaunders999/cmake_bs

cmake_bs content can be accessed by cloning it into the project using it.
Running the script *bs_clone.cmake* does this.

To use the scripts copy bs_clone.cmake to your project dir, and include it 
as shown in the example CMakeLists.txt file.


Usage
-----

The build system scripts are placed in ${buildsystem_SOURCE_DIR}
